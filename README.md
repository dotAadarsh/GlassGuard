# GlassGuard
A Real-Time Glass Breaking Detection System Using Edge Impulse

## Introduction

The problem to develop a system that can detect the sound of breaking glass in real-time using Low cost microcontroller and [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) machine learning platform. This system can be used for various applications such as home security, commercial building security, car alarm systems, and glass safety monitoring in public areas such as parks or playgrounds.

By using Edge Impulse, the system can be trained to detect the unique sound signature of breaking glass and distinguish it from other sounds such as traffic or animals. The acoustic sensors capture the sound waves generated by the breaking glass, and the signal is processed by the Edge Impulse algorithm to identify the glass-breaking event. Once the event is detected, the system can trigger an alarm, send a notification to the owner's mobile device, or activate a camera to capture the event.

This system will be useful in improving the safety and security of homes and public places by detecting glass-breaking events in real-time. It can help prevent burglaries, vandalism, and other crimes related to glass breaking. Additionally, it can provide a cost-effective solution for glass safety monitoring in public areas, which can reduce the risk of injury from broken glass.

## The building process

Edge Impulse Studio provides a comprehensive platform for building and deploying machine learning models for edge devices. It simplifies the process of collecting sensor data, training models, and deploying them to edge devices. So sign up here](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/signup) to get started!


- Create a new project in edge impulse studio
![Dashboard-Edge-Impulse](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71810927/230767885-45a0859b-5e0f-4fb4-8fe6-fb334860f266.png)

- Next we need to integrate the edge impulse studio with Infineon CY8CKIT-062S2 Pioneer Kit. The Infineon CY8CKIT-062S2 Pioneer Kit is an ideal platform for developing embedded systems and IoT devices that require low power consumption, high processing capabilities, and connectivity options. It is suitable for a wide range of applications such as industrial automation, consumer electronics, medical devices, and smart home appliances. Follow [this](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/development-platforms/officially-supported-mcu-targets/infineon-cy8ckit-062s2) article to integrate with Edge Impulse. Once you install the cyprogrammer and programmed the infineon kit, and when you run `edge-impulse-daemon` in terminal, you will be able to see the device.

- Data acquisition - This is the main part of our project. We need to collect as musch as data to train out model. For our project, we need sounds which includes glass breaking and household sound. I have used some audios present on the YouTube. I have classifed the dataset into two - glass break and normal. The more the data, the more the accuracy. Try capturing as much as data as possible. Click on start sampling to collect the data from the hardware. You can also see the log in the terminal.

- Impusle design -  impulse design is the process of creating a machine learning model for a specific use case or application. The impulse is a collection of data, machine learning models, and deployment configurations that can be used to generate an optimized firmware library for deployment on edge devices.

Check out [this](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/tutorials/audio-classification) audio classification project to understand better.

- Model testing in Edge Impulse is an important step in the impulse design process. Once you have created a machine learning model, you need to evaluate its performance to ensure that it is accurate and reliable.
