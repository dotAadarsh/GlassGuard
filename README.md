# GlassGuard
A Real-Time Glass Breaking Detection System Using Edge Impulse

## Introduction

The problem to develop a system that can detect the sound of breaking glass in real-time using Low cost microcontroller and [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) machine learning platform. This system can be used for various applications such as home security, commercial building security, car alarm systems, and glass safety monitoring in public areas such as parks or playgrounds.

By using Edge Impulse, the system can be trained to detect the unique sound signature of breaking glass and distinguish it from other sounds such as traffic or animals. The acoustic sensors capture the sound waves generated by the breaking glass, and the signal is processed by the Edge Impulse algorithm to identify the glass-breaking event. Once the event is detected, the system can trigger an alarm, send a notification to the owner's mobile device, or activate a camera to capture the event.

This system will be useful in improving the safety and security of homes and public places by detecting glass-breaking events in real-time. It can help prevent burglaries, vandalism, and other crimes related to glass breaking. Additionally, it can provide a cost-effective solution for glass safety monitoring in public areas, which can reduce the risk of injury from broken glass.
